/**
 * Discussion. Trying to use objects at very low levels of granularity is nice, 
 * but the overhead may be prohibitive. 
 * Flyweight suggests removing the non-sharable state from the class, 
 * and having the client supply it when methods are called. 
 * This places more responsibility on the client, 
 * but, considerably fewer instances of the Flyweight class are now created. 
 * Sharing of these instances is facilitated by introducing a Factory class 
 * that maintains a "cache" of existing Flyweights.
